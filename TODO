- gui for admins to add other admins, advisors, students, parents
- css for student tables

To do (updated 20200601)

NOTE: for views.py and __init__.py, old code is in triple quotes, so should be easy to swap back to how it was before

If we want to continue using SQLAlchemy, FlaskForms, flask_login etc.
1. Get SQLAlchemy connected to MySQL db
- This should be straightforward; think I'm just messing up app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] somehow.
- Right now it's connecting to a SQLite db. Shouldn't have to change any code when we switch to MySQL.

2. Security features to make Create New User secure.
- Right now anyone can say they're a supervisor etc. so not great security-wise.

3. Cleaning up Registration Page in general so it has login/logout functionality (now it just says logout)

4. Functional and authorization-level-relevant login and logout pages

Also happy to collaborate and clarify what each of us wants to tackle.
