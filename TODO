- gui for admins to add other admins, advisors, students, parents
- sorting via column name

To do (updated 20200604)

If we want to continue using SQLAlchemy, FlaskForms, flask_login etc.

Update: first pass completion of tasks 1, 3, and 4

1. Get SQLAlchemy connected to MySQL db - done

2. Security features to make Create New User secure.
- Right now anyone can say they're a supervisor etc. so not great security-wise.

3. Cleaning up Registration Page in general so it has login/logout functionality - done

4. Functional and authorization-level-relevant login and logout pages - done

Also happy to collaborate and clarify what each of us wants to tackle.
